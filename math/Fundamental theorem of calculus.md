# First
If $f(x)$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$, then
* $F(b) - F(a) = \int^b_a f(x)dx$

# Second
If $f(x)$ is continuous on an open interval $I$ containing $a$, then for every $x$ in $I$,
$\dfrac{d}{dx}(\int^x_a f(t)dt)=f(x)$
