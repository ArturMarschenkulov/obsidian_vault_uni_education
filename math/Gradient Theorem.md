It is a generalization of the [[Fundamental theorem of calculus]].


It is about [[Line Integral]] and [[Conservative vector fields]].


The curve $C$ starts at point $a$ and ends at point $b$. Let $\vec{r}$ be a parameterization of $C$, with $\vec{r}(a)=A$ and $\vec{r}(b)=B$. Also assume that $\vec{F}=\nabla f$.

$$\int_C \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}=f(B) - f(A)$$
