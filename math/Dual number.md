> [!note] Introduction to Dual Numbers
Dual numbers extend the real numbers, analogous to the extension of real numbers by complex numbers. Primarily utilized in fields like automatic differentiation, robotics, and symbolic computation, dual numbers have a unique form $a + b\epsilon$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. The element $\epsilon$ is defined by the property $\epsilon^2 = 0$ while $\epsilon \neq 0$. This non-trivial property facilitates the efficient computation of derivatives.

# Dual Numbers: A Formal Exposition

## Introduction

Dual numbers extend the field of real numbers in a manner analogous to the extension of reals by complex numbers. They are particularly advantageous in applications such as automatic differentiation, robotics, and symbolic computation, where the efficient evaluation of derivatives is paramount.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Unlike numerical approximation methods (e.g., finite differences), dual numbers allow for the exact computation of derivatives by algebraic manipulation.

## Definition and Fundamental Properties

> [!DEFINITION]
> **Definition:** The set of *dual numbers*, denoted by $\mathbb{D}$, is defined as
> $$
> \mathbb{D} = \{\, a + b\epsilon \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \; \epsilon^2 = 0, \; \epsilon \neq 0 \,\}.
> $$
> Here, $a$ is called the *real part* and $b$ the *dual part* of the dual number $a + b\epsilon$. The element $\epsilon$ is nilpotent of index $2$, meaning that $\epsilon^2 = 0$, yet $\epsilon$ itself is nonzero.

## Algebraic Operations

The arithmetic of dual numbers is defined by operations analogous to those for real numbers, with the additional property that $\epsilon^2 = 0$.

### Addition

Let 
$$
x = a + b\epsilon \quad \text{and} \quad y = c + d\epsilon
$$ 
be two dual numbers. Their sum is given by
$$
x + y = (a + c) + (b + d)\epsilon.
$$

### Multiplication

The product of the dual numbers $x = a + b\epsilon$ and $y = c + d\epsilon$ is computed as follows:
$$
x \cdot y = (a + b\epsilon)(c + d\epsilon) = ac + (ad + bc)\epsilon + bd\,\epsilon^2.
$$
Since $\epsilon^2 = 0$, this expression simplifies to
$$
x \cdot y = ac + (ad + bc)\epsilon.
$$

## Applications

Dual numbers are utilized in several areas of mathematics and engineering:

- **Automatic Differentiation:** Extending a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ to dual numbers, i.e., computing $f(a + b\epsilon)$, allows one to extract the derivative $f'(a)$ directly from the coefficient of $\epsilon$.
- **Robotic Motion Planning:** In robotics, dual numbers facilitate the representation of screw transformations, which are essential in describing and controlling rigid body movements.
- **Symbolic Computation:** The simultaneous propagation of both the value and its derivative information through algebraic operations simplifies symbolic differentiation.

## Examples

> [!EXAMPLE]
> **Example (Addition):**  
> Let $x = 1 + 2\epsilon$ and $y = 3 + 4\epsilon$. Their sum is calculated as:
> $$
> (1 + 2\epsilon) + (3 + 4\epsilon) = (1 + 3) + (2 + 4)\epsilon = 4 + 6\epsilon.
> $$

> [!EXAMPLE]
> **Example (Multiplication):**  
> Consider the product of the dual numbers $x = 1 + 2\epsilon$ and $y = 3 + 4\epsilon$:
> $$
> (1 + 2\epsilon)(3 + 4\epsilon) = 1\cdot3 + (1\cdot4 + 2\cdot3)\epsilon + 2\cdot4\,\epsilon^2.
> $$
> Since $\epsilon^2 = 0$, it follows that
> $$
> (1 + 2\epsilon)(3 + 4\epsilon) = 3 + 10\epsilon.
> $$

> [!EXAMPLE]
> **Example (Differentiation):**  
> Let $f(x) = 3x + 2$ be a linear function. For a dual number $x = a + b\epsilon$, we have:
> $$
> f(a + b\epsilon) = 3(a + b\epsilon) + 2 = 3a + 3b\epsilon + 2.
> $$
> The coefficient of $\epsilon$, namely $3b$, represents the derivative $f'(a) = 3$ (scaled by $b$).

## Exercises with Solutions

> [!EXAMPLE]
> **Exercise 1: Addition**  
> **Problem:** Compute the sum of the dual numbers $5 + 3\epsilon$ and $2 + 4\epsilon$.  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> (5 + 3\epsilon) + (2 + 4\epsilon) = (5+2) + (3+4)\epsilon = 7 + 7\epsilon.
> $$

> [!EXAMPLE]
> **Exercise 2: Multiplication**  
> **Problem:** Compute the product of the dual numbers $4 + \epsilon$ and $3 + 2\epsilon$.  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> (4 + \epsilon)(3 + 2\epsilon) = 4\cdot3 + (4\cdot2 + 1\cdot3)\epsilon + \epsilon\cdot2\epsilon = 12 + 11\epsilon,
> $$
> since $\epsilon^2 = 0$.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> **Exercise 3: Differentiation**  
> **Problem:** Evaluate the function $f(x) = x^2$ at the dual number $2 + \epsilon$.  
> **Solution:**  
> $$
> f(2 + \epsilon) = (2 + \epsilon)^2 = 4 + 4\epsilon + \epsilon^2 = 4 + 4\epsilon.
> $$
> In this context, the coefficient of $\epsilon$, which is $4$, corresponds to the derivative $f'(2) = 4$.

These examples and exercises illustrate the efficacy of dual numbers in simplifying algebraic operations and facilitating automatic differentiation.
