Is a method to solve nth order differential equations. It only works when the differential equation is linear and homogeneous and has constant coefficients. In practice it is usually used on second order differential equation, however they are also used on lower ones (first order) and higher.

$ay''+by'+cy=0$ becomes $ar^2+br+c=0$.

Then the next step is to get the roots and depending on how the roots look like it determines how the solution looks like.

# Roots
## Distinct real roots
e.g.:
- $y(t)=c_1e^{r_1t}+c_2e^{r_2t}$
## Repeated real roots
e.g.:
- $y(t)=c_1e^{rt}+c_2te^{rt}=(c_1+c_2t)e^{rt}$

## Complex roots
e.g.:
- $y(t)=c_1e^{at}\cos(bt)+c_2e^{at}\sin(bt)$.
