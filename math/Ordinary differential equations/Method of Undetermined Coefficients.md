This method is used to get the particular solution.

Let there be $y''+ py'+qy=g(x)$ and $y=y_h+y_p$. This method is about getting the $y_p$ aka the value of $g(x)$. It is important that the $p$ and $q$ are constants/coefficients.

To get $y_h$ one uses some method to get that. Usually [[Characteristic Equation]] is used to do that, but feel free to use other methods.

The second step is $y_p$. This is based on first analyzing how $g(x)$ looks like.
