Implicit form
$F(x, y, y', y'', ..., y^{(n)})=0$

Explicit form
$y^{n}=f(x, y, y', y'', ..., y^{(n)})$


# Attributes
## Order
- [[1st Order differential Equation]]
- [[2nd Order Differential Equation]]
## Autonomous
Basically when $q(t)$ and $p(t)$ are constants, usually then written as $q$ and $p$.

## Homogeneity
Linear ODEs can be divided into homogeneous and non-homogeneous.

A linear ODE is homogeneous, when $q(t)=0$, otherwise it is non-homogeneous.

The solutions to non-homogeneous linear ODEs looks like this:
$$y=y_h+y_p$$
$y_h$ is the solution to the linear ODE if one sets $q(t)=0$, while $y_p$ is the particular solution
