The most widely used definition is the one below, however it is not mathematically rigorous.
$$\begin{equation}
\delta(t)=

\begin{cases}
+\infty & : t = 0\\
0       & : t \neq 0
\end{cases}

\end{equation}$$
The most important and defined feature of this function is its integral:
$$
\int \delta(t) dt = 1
$$
There are better ways to define this function:
$$
\delta(t) = \lim_{a \to 0} \dfrac{1}{a} rect(\dfrac{t}{a})
$$

$$
\delta(t) = \lim_{a \to 0} \dfrac{1}{\pi}\dfrac{a}{a^2+t^2}
$$
